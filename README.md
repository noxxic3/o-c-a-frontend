# Obesity Control App (frontend)

## Description
This is the frontend repository for the Obesity Control App project.

Obesity Control App is a personal project that consists of a web application for a supposed obesity clinic interested in providing obesity treatments to its patients.

The application allows:
- That patients enter weekly data on their physical state and can consult the treatment that is being assigned to these states.
- That doctors can assign treatments to the physical states of patients who have not yet been assigned treatment, as well as search for patients to consult their history of states.
- That the office staff can manage the users of the application.
- That the administrator can do the same tasks as doctors and office personnel, and also be able to manage the treatments offered by the entity.

The frontend is a SPA developed with <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank"> <img src="public/favicon.ico"> </a> version **2**, which connects to the backend invoking its endpoints and is in charge of maintaining the user state.
The backend is in this [repository](https://github.com/noxxic3/o-c-a-backend).
